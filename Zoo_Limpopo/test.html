I apologize for any confusion. If the text is disappearing, it might be due to the text-overflow property being set to 'clip.' To ensure that the text is visible but still does not have horizontal scroll, you can change the text-overflow property to ellipsis instead. This will display an ellipsis (...) to indicate that the text has been truncated. Here's the modified example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Text Outside Window Example</title>
<style>
  .container {
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    width: 100%;
    border: 1px solid #000;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    This is a long line of text that will be truncated at the edge of the container with an ellipsis, without any horizontal scrollbars.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
